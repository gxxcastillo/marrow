## Persistence

This directory is a git worktree of the private marrow vault (branch: `{{branch}}`).
It is never committed to the parent repo. Convention: `marrow convention`.

- Updating this directory is part of finishing work, not a wrap-up chore: when work
  lands, a decision is made, or a plan changes status, update `current-state.md` in the
  same step, then `marrow sync {{project}} -m "<one-line summary of what changed>"`.
- On session start, check `current-state.md`'s `As of` stamp against `git log`;
  reconcile before building on stale state.
- Edit files in place; git history replaces inline correction narrative.
- `marrow status` shows unsynced changes; `marrow doctor` checks the setup.
